When given the --management-external-key option, OpenVPN does not use a private
key to sign SSL handshakes, but instead requests a signature over the
management interface.

This is a simple client for the management interface that uses a private key
stored in a PEM file to create the signatures.

You'll need PolarSSL to compile this code. Run management_external_key for
instructions.

Note that this is not production-ready code. It may, however, be useful for
testing purposes.
